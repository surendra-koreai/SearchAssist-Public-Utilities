3,Factors that affect Term Insurance Premium,https://www.idfcfirstbank.com/personal-banking/investments-and-insurance,"Listed below are some of the major factors that affect term insurance premium:

Age: It is a general belief that when a person is young, then they are less prone to life-threatening diseases. This means that a young person will be paying more term plan premiums as the policy term would be long when compared to someone who is old and most likely will make term insurance claims soon.
Gender: As per some studies, it is believed that women tend to survive for a longer span in comparison to men. This implies that women will end up paying more term insurance premiums, which means that the premium amount will be low comparatively.
Policy Term: The longer is the policy term, the more will be the term insurance premium as the insurance provider will have to provide cover for a long time which means higher risk. Therefore, a shorter-term plan will have a low premium when compared to the long-term plans.
Profession: In the case of individuals involved in job profiles with a probability of high risk of accidents such as transport, mining, shipping, defence etc.., the term insurance premium for such profiles will be higher when compared to the job profile of someone who has a desk job.
Individual Health: In case an individual has a common disease or illness such as obesity, the underwriters will scale the person on a high risk. For instance, in the case of an obese person, there are chances of high blood pressure and heart-related ailments that could even lead to stroke. Under such circumstances, the term insurance premium will be on a higher side when compared to the person who is physically sound and fit.
Smoking/ Drinking Habits: This is one key factor that affects the term insurance premium. There are high chances of health concerns due to the regular consumption of alcohol or smoking as it might affect the individual adversely.",Factors that affect Term Insurance Premium,,,,,,,
4,Term Insurance Buying Guide,https://www.idfcfirstbank.com/personal-banking/investments-and-insurance,"To select the best term insurance plan, a purchaser should look into the following factors:

Claim Settlement Ratio: The record of term insurance claim settlement provides a clear picture of the insurance provider to the prospect policy buyers. The ratio of claim settlement is released by the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA) India every year. A claim settlement ratio that is consistently good indicates that the insurance provider has been quick and robust in its claim settlement process.
Terminal/Critical Illness Benefit: A critical medical issue such as brain surgery or cancer costs a lot of money and cripples the finances of the family. However, if a term plan chosen by a policyholder covers critical illness or if it has the feature to add on critical illness cover in it, then one can easily safeguard self from such risks. Most of the critical illness add-ons immediately payout upon diagnosis of the critical illness.
Company Reliability: The reputation of a company and stability is very important in any sector of business, especially in the sector of life insurance for the customers to trust. Before zeroing in on a plan, it is important to check the credibility of the insurance company.
Premium: The premium rate of a term plan plays a vital role while purchasing the plan.
Waiver of Premium Rider: If the policyholder gets affected by some terminal illness, then all the future premiums for his/her term policy will be waived off.
Solvency Ratio: The solvency ratio is something that tells whether the insurance provider chosen will be capable financially of settling the claims if the requirement arises. As per IRDA, every life insurance provider should maintain a solvency ratio of 1.5 at least.
Riders: While purchasing a term plan, it is important to check the rider benefits offered by the term insurance company in a detailed way.
