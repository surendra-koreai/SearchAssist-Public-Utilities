Analysis of Personal Investment Goals: Before choosing a ULIP plan; it is a pre-condition for every investor to analyse their long-term financial goals. It is mandated to opt for a ULIP that is in sync with the investment horizon and the investment goals.

Decide Insurance Objectives: One should first decide the insurance objectives and then select a ULIP plan that fulfils them. If one is young, current and future family requirements need to be considered because the insurance cover should be adequate if something happens to the insured.

Decide Investment Goals: Investment goals are extremely important. Investment goals may vary from having a corpus for the higher education requirements of the children after some years to having sizeable funds for the child’s marriage. They may also include having the requisite amount of money for post-retirement needs.

Flexibility: Yet another factor that is to be taken into consideration while choosing a ULIP plan is the flexibility that is offered by the intended unit-linked plan. Here are two things that the investor must consider on the parameters of flexibility:

·         Policy Tenure Flexibility: Many ULIP plans are long-term; resultantly, they tag along with a lock-in period of 3 to 5 years. Before investing, investors should analyse the investment horizon.

·         Investment Flexibility: The unit-linked insurance plan allows the policyholders to pick the investment options even before investing in their intended unit-linked insurance plans. Basis on the risk appetite, the investors can choose from hybrid, equity, or debt ULIP plans.

Evaluate Risk Profile and Financial Stability: It is important to appraise one’s risk profile before choosing a ULIP plan. Younger people typically have a higher risk appetite hence opt for equity-focused plans while the low-risk appetite cluster invests in debt instruments that provide stability albeit with limited returns.

Understand Different Charges Levied: While choosing a ULIP plan, we need to understand the charges. These include initial charges, premium allocation fee, fund management fee, surrender charges, mortality charges, and administration and service charges. Proper information and knowledge about charges help to choose the right ULIP plan.

Check the Performance of the Plan: To understand if the funds are performing well, we evaluate the performance of the ULIP plan for the past 3 to 4 years against benchmark indices like Nifty and Sensex to understand whether the funds are performing well.

Claim Settlement Ratio: The claim settlement ratio refers to the percentage of claims settled by the insurance company as compared to the total numbers of claims received by the company.

Investment Strategies Offered: There are many ULIP plans which provide an opportunity to make a strategic investment like if you want to create a financial cushion for retirement then you can invest in retirement ULIP plan or if you want to make an investment to provide financial security to your child then you can invest in a child ULIP plan.",How to Choose the Best ULIP plans?

While the returns are lower in comparison to equity, the risk is low as well. The returns from these funds are slightly higher than cash funds.

Balanced or Hybrid Funds: They combine equity investment with fixed interest instruments and are of medium risk in nature. These hybrid funds give adequate exposure to stock markets as well as debt instruments. The risk inherent in equity is counterbalanced by the safer investments in debt.

Equity Funds: These ULIP funds fall in the medium to the high-risk category as they primarily invest in company stocks with the objective of capital appreciation.

The rate and the slabs at which these charges are levied have been regulated by IRDA and the charge shall not exceed 50 basis points per annum on the unit fund value and no other charge apart from this shall be levied by the insurer on surrender of the policy.

Mortality Charges: When a policy is issued, the insurer provides the cover based on the policyholder’s life expectancy (factors like gender, age, health conditions etc.) In case the policyholder does not survive till the expected age, the mortality charges compensate the insurer.

Fund Management Charges: This is levied by the insurer towards managing the policyholder’s funds. As per guidelines given by IRDA, these charges must not cross the capping of 1.5% and is chargeable as a percentage of the fund. These charges vary from fund to fund.

Fund Switching Charges: These charges are charged by the insurer when the policyholder switches between fund options. ULIPs offer a limited number of fund-switch options and while doing so, the policyholder has to pay some charges to the insurer.

Discontinuance Charges: On premature discontinuation of a plan within the lock-in period, the insurer deducts a small fee. Since these charges are preset by IRDA, these are the same for almost all policies.

Partial Withdrawal Charges: The policyholder can carry out lump sum withdrawals from the fund after the policy lapses and subject to the pre-determined conditions. Nevertheless, the partial withdrawals attract charges, as specified in the respective policy document.",ULIP Charges

Super Top Up Plan: In a Super Top Up Plan, the insured will pay health insurance deductible before the insurance company picks up the remainder of your bill. The insured is free to choose this threshold value, called “deductible” before any hospitalisation claim up to the limit of Sum Insured shall become payable. As a portion of the risk, as “deductible”, is borne by the insured himself/ herself, these plans are cheaper when compared to regular indemnity health insurance policies.

Benefit Plan: In these plans, a pre-defined fixed benefit becomes payable on a pre-defined health insurance risk viz. 24-hour hospitalisation, diagnosis of critical illness, accidental injuries etc. E.g. Rs. 1,000 becomes payable on 24-hour hospitalisation for each day insured is hospitalised for a maximum of 30 days in a policy year.",Types of Health Insurance Plans

Some Myths about Health Insurance,https://www.idfcfirstbank.com/personal-banking/insurance/health-insurance#faqs,"I am healthy, and I don't need Health Insurance

Despite taking good care of your health, there are numerous unforeseen circumstances like seasonal illnesses, dengue, malaria, or an accident that can hit anyone at any time. Nowadays, hospitalization expenses are not easy to pay off. Even 2-days of hospitalization expenses would cost you somewhere between INR 60,000 to INR 1 lakh and even more (depending on the type of illness) whereas, an insurance premium usually would be a fraction of a cost that one would incur in event of a hospitalisation.  

My Health Insurance will cover all the medical expenses

All health insurance plans come with their own set of exclusions and limitations. It is required that you check all the policy details and the coverage that is mentioned in the plan. The insurer will only compensate for the expenses that are covered in the policy and up to the specified limit.

Declaration of Pre-existing Diseases

It is essential to declare all the pre-existing diseases in the proposal form. One must mention pre-existing diseases clearly before buying an online health insurance policy. Inadequate information can lead to the rejection of the claim and can cost more than the expected amount.
